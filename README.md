[![Binder](https://beta.mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/VivianePons/SWeakOrder)


You will find here some raw research code and a demo related to the following papers:

[1] C. Ceballos and V. Pons, s-Weak Order and s-Weak Permutahedra

They present examples and implementations of the computations and algorithms described in the papers. You can run them yourself and experiment by [clicking on this binder link](hhttps://mybinder.org/v2/gh/VivianePons/SWeakOrder). (Expect to wait a few minutes for the server to load).
